Purpose for the Meal suggestion App 

The purpose of the Meal suggestion App is to provide meal suggestions based on the user-input time of the day.When a user inputs a specific time of the day, the app will suggest which meal to eat at that specific time of the day. 

 

Kotlin was used to design the App 

For the App to properly function and do its purpose it will have the following features: 

•timeEditText: where the user types in the time of the day like morning or afternoon 

•mealSuggestion: It is used a label in this case it is the name of the App 

•resetButton: It is a button that clears everything that was input when clicked. 

•confirmButton: It is a button that will show a meal suggestion when clicked. 

•mealOutput: It is a TextView where the meal suggestion will be displayed 

 

Confirm Button logic  

It grabs the text that user has input, cleans it up and then it checks what user has input and gives a meal suggestion. 

Based on the user input it will pick the matching meal.  

If the input does not match any of the known times, it will show a helpful error message to input the correct time. 

 

Reset Button logic  

It grabs the text that user has input and clears it out
